# WSA-old-cricket-project
This was a starter project in which I analyzed top test run scorers, to see what other stats correlated with their test runs. This was a beginner project mostly done to practice web scraping with beautiful soup, converting online data to a useable CSV, and tinkering with jupyter notebook. 
Run_scorers.py uses BeautifulSoup to turn an ESPN webpage into a table, and storing it in a SQL database, which was turned into CSV, Run_scorers.py.
Cricket_data.ipynb does some basic analysis of the data from the CSV.
